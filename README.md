## About the Project : 

This application provides various features to the user. These features will help him/her to manage daily events, note down stuff, remind of meetings or functions and in the meantime, a bit of drawing for fun. The team members have applied most of their efforts to make the app more user friendly providing an attractive UI design and time saving features like voice commands and speech to text. Various features used in the app work accordingly and will help the user manage his day.

## Theory :

This project is made using the Programming Language **Dart** in **Flutter** Framework.
* **Flutter** is a framework introduced by Google to code applications and websites with an ease. It is much different than other frameworks used, as it gives the programmer a simultaneous visualisation of the application or website.
* **Dart**, on the other hand, is a programming language, also introduced by Google, which provides a number of packages for improvisation in the code, making it code much shorter and easy to understand.
* The basic motivation behind this project is to learn and study the language as well as the framework.
* The basic working on flutter includes installing packages. All the required packages related to flutter and dart can be found on https://pub.dev/
